count_debugula
==============

A simple vim script that creates print lines with an incrementing variable for debugging purposes

How to use
-
The default mapping for inserting the print line is \<Leader>d

I like to use , as my leader key; hey maybe you'd like that too

How to install
-
1.  Download and set up [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
2.  Clone this repo into your ~/.vim/bundle folder with: `git clone https://github.com/whoisdylan/count_debugula.git`

TODO
-
- support many programming languages
- have a mapping for resetting the counter
- keep track of counter after leaving a file
- allow custom mappings
